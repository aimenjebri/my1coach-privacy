## Introduction

My1Coach ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

- **Personalization:** Customizing content and recommendations
- **Analytics:** Understanding App performance and user behavior
- **Security:** Detecting and preventing fraud, abuse, and security issues

## Data Storage and Security

### Data Storage

- All data is stored locally on your device using iOS native storage (UserDefaults and local file system)
- Your data never leaves your device
- We do not have access to your personal information
- If you delete the app, all your data is permanently deleted

### Security Measures

We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your information:

- All data is stored locally on your device, protected by iOS security
- We use iOS built-in encryption and sandboxing
- No network transmission of personal data
- Access to the app is controlled by your device's security (Face ID, passcode, etc.)

However, no method of storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your data using iOS security features, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

**We do not sell your personal information.** We do not share your information with any third parties because all your data stays on your device.

In the future, if we integrate third-party services, we will update this policy and notify you.

### Legal Requirements (Hypothetical)

While we do not collect your data, if we were ever legally required to provide information and had access to it, we would comply with valid legal processes such as:

- Legal processes (subpoenas, court orders)
- Government or regulatory requests

**Note:** Since your data is stored locally on your device and we have no access to it, we cannot provide your personal information even if requested.

## Your Rights and Choices
